# Level Load

Optimizes some inefficient level setup code that has quadratic-time performance... if you have a group with a ton of decorative objects that is targeted by a rotate or scale trigger.

**This means it only really affects high-object-count levels with lots of rotation or scaling!**

*lowkey just lets LIMBO load faster.*
